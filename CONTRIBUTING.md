## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
If you find a bug, please check the issue tracker to see if it has already been reported. If not, create a new issue with the following information:

## Submitting Changes

To submit changes, please follow these steps:

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine if you haven’t already.

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/yourorganization/your-repo.git>
cd your-repo
```

### Create a New Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Make Your Changes

Make the necessary changes to the codebase. Use your preferred code editor to modify the files.

### Stage Your Changes

Add the files you modified to the staging area. This prepares them for a commit.

```bash
git add .
```

### Commit Your Changes

Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message. This records your changes in the branch.

```bash
git commit -m "Add some feature"
```

### Push to Your Branch

Push your changes to the branch on the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Open a Pull Request

Create a pull request to propose your changes to the main branch.

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the “Compare & pull request” button: This appears after you push your changes.
3. Fill out the pull request form: Provide a clear title and description of your changes. Mention any related issues or context.
4. Submit the pull request: Click the “Create pull request” button.

### Additional Tips

- **Keep Pull Requests Small**: Smaller pull requests are easier to review and less likely to introduce bugs.
- **Review Your Changes**: Before submitting, review your changes to ensure they are correct and complete.
- **Provide Context**: In the pull request description, explain briefly the related feature and what they do.
